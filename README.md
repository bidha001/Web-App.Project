This project was collaboratively developed by a group of students as part of the IDATA2301 Web Technologies
and IDATA2306 Application development course at NTNU. Each member contributed significantly across different areas 
including backend development,  frontend design, database integration, user interface design, testing, and documentation.

## Use of AI Tools
During the development of this project, AI tools such as ChatGPT and DeepSeek were used for clarification, guidance, and
idea refinement. These tools supported the team in better understanding group ideas, improving code structure, and 
aligning with best practices. All ideas and concepts implemented in the project originated from the team and were not 
generated by AI tools. Every piece of code was thoroughly reviewed and understood to ensure clear comprehension and 
intentional implementation.
